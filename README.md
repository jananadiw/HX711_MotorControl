# Motor Control Weight sensor

This was part of implementing the project 'Smart Pet Care System'. 
The system was programed to monitor the pets remotely, when the owner is not available.
It will feed the pets after sensing its presence (by weight) thought a load cell which connected to a motor, 
which the motor then starts running and serve food to the pet.
